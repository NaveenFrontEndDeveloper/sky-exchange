		<h1>Self-exclusion Policy</h1>

	<div class="tc-content mt-5 d-inline-block font-14" style="padding: 15px;">
		<p>If you feel you are at risk of developing a gambling problem or believe you currently have a gambling problem, please consider using Self-Exclusion
	which prevents you gambling with Skyexch.art for a specified period of 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years or permanently.</p>
<p>If you want to stop playing for other reasons, please consider a Time-Out or using Account Closure.</p>
<h3>What happens when you self-exclude?</h3>
<p>During a period of Self-Exclusion you will not be able to use your account for betting, although you will still be able to login and withdraw any
	remaining balance. It will not be possible to re-open your account for any reason, and Skyexch.art will do all it can to detect and close
	any new accounts you may open.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Whilst we will remove you from our marketing databases, we also suggest that you remove Skyexch.art from your notifications and
	delete/uninstall all Skyexch.art apps, downloads and social media links. You may also wish to consider installing software that blocks
	access to gambling websites, click here for more information.</p>
<p>We recommend that you seek support from a problem gambling support service to help you deal with your problem.</p>
<p>You can self-exclude your account in the My Gambling Controls section of Members by choosing Self-Exclusion.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can contact our customer care team for assistance and further information.</p>
<h3> Self-Exclusion Notice</h3>
<p>Should you opt to self-exclude from Skyexch.art, we strongly recommend that you seek exclusion from all other gambling operators you have
	an account with.</p>
<p>You can self-exclude by contacting other gambling operators directly or you can exclude from other licensed operators by completing a
	Self-Exclusion Notice form.</p>
<p>Once completed the Self-Exclusion Notice form should be submitted to the nominated site, sports bookmaker or betting exchange operator.</p>
