		<p>
			It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to open an account or gamble with <a href="https://www.skyexch.art/" target="_blank">https://www.skyexch.art/</a>(hereinafter
			"Skyexch.art"). We strictly prohibit
			minors from registering or gambling, and we require new members to declare that they are over 18 years
			of age.
		</p>

		<p>
			Skyexch.art takes all reasonable steps to prevent underage gamblers from accessing and using our
			services, including the use of identity verification services to ensure that all users are eligible to
			play. As a registered user, you can help us prevent underage gambling online.
		</p>

		<p>
			Especially if you access your Skyexch.art account on a shared computer, or if you have underage
			individuals in your household, it's important that you take precautions to prevent underage gambling. Do
			not use software that saves your username and password on shared devices, and consider installing
			parental control programs that can help prevent minors from accessing online gambling websites.
		</p>

		<p>
			Skyexch.art includes several mechanisms that can help you detect unauthorized use of your player
			account. Note the last login time and IP address when you log into your account, and review your game
			transactions and financial transactions in your account details to ensure that there is no suspicious
			activity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Parents with immediate concerns about underage gambling should report immediately to either email
			<a href="mailto:support@skyexch">support@skyexch.art</a> or the support chat.
