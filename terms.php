		<h3>8. Payment Transactions and Processors</h3>
		
		<p>
			You are fully responsible for paying all monies owed to us. You must make all payments to us in good
			faith and not attempt to
			reverse a payment made or take any action which will cause such payment to be reversed by a third party
			in order to avoid a
			liability legitimately incurred. You will reimburse us for any charge-backs, denial or reversal of
			payment you make and any loss
			suffered by us as a consequence thereof. We reserve the right to also impose an administration fee of
			€60, or currency equivalent
			per charge-back, denial or reversal of payment you make.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We reserve the right to use third party electronic payment processors and or merchant banks to process
			payments made by you and
			you agree to be bound by their terms and conditions providing they are made aware to you and those terms
			do not conflict with
			these Terms.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All transactions made on our site might be checked to prevent money laundering or terrorism financing
			activity. Suspicious
			transactions will be reported to the relevant authority depending on the jurisdiction governing the
			transaction.
		</p>
		
		<h3>9. Errors</h3>
		
		<p>
			In the event of an error or malfunction of our system or processes, all bets are rendered void. You are
			under an obligation to
			inform us immediately as soon as you become aware of any error with the service. In the event of
			communication or system errors or
			bugs or viruses occurring in connection with the service and/or payments made to you as a result of a
			defect or effort in the
			Service, we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any direct or indirect costs, expenses,
			losses or claims arising
			or resulting from such errors, and we reserve the right to void all games/bets in question and take any
			other action to correct
			such errors.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the event of a casino system malfunction, or disconnection issues, all bets are rendered void. In the
			event of such error or
			any system failure or game error that results in an error in any odds calculation, charges, fees, rake,
			bonuses or payout, or any
			currency conversion as applicable, or other casino system malfunction (the “Casino Error”), we reserve
			the right to declare null
			and void any wagers or bets that were the subject of such Casino Error and to take any money from your
			Account relating to the
			relevant bets or wagers.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We make every effort to ensure that we do not make errors in posting lines. However, if as a result of
			human error or system
			problems a bet is accepted at an odd that is: materially different from those available in the general
			market at the time the bet
			was made; or clearly incorrect given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made then
			we reserve the right to
			cancel or void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an event has started.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid and to adjust your account to rectify any
			mistake. An example of such a
			mistake might be where a price is incorrect or where we enter a result of an event incorrectly. If there
			are insufficient funds in
			your Account, we may demand that you pay us the relevant outstanding amount relating to any erroneous
			bets or wagers. Accordingly,
			we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or delete any pending plays, whether placed with funds resulting
			from the error or not.
		</p>
		
		<h3>10. General Rules</h3>
		
		<p>If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the general rule will not apply.</p>
		
		<p>
			The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event’s settlement; we do not recognise
			protested or overturned
			decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an event suspended after the start of competition will be
			decided according to the
			wagering rules specified for that sport by us.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will be entertained after that period of
			time. Within 72 hours
			after results are posted, the company will only reset/correct the results due to human error, system
			error or mistakes made by the
			referring results source.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be determined by us and are subject to
			change without prior written
			notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on individual Accounts as well.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Customers are solely responsible for their own account transactions. Please be sure to review your
			wagers for any mistakes before
			sending them in. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be changed. We do not take responsibility for
			missing or duplicate
			wagers made by the Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or
			duplicated. Customers may
			review their transactions in the My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all
			requested wagers were accepted.
		</p>
		
		<p>For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No Proposition, the contestant must enter and
			compete in the event.</p>
		
		<p>
			We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and away teams by indicating the home and
			away team by means of
			vertical placement on the desktop site version. This means in American Sports we would place the home
			team on the bottom. For
			Non-US sports, we would indicate the home team on top. In the case of a neutral venue, we attempt to
			include the letter “N” next
			to the team names to indicate this. For the Asian and mobile versions, we do not distinguish between
			European and American Sports.
			On the Asian and mobile versions of the site, the home team is always listed first. However, we do not
			guarantee the accuracy of
			this information and unless there is an official venue change subsequent to bets being placed, all
			wagers have action.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is associated with the matchup. For
			example, two teams from
			the same League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup is mistakenly placed in the League
			offering, the game/match will
			still have action, as long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have action as long
			as the two teams are
			correct, and regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our Website.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the
			event have no action. If an
			event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers have action based on the date announced by the
			governing body.
		</p>
		
		<p>Skyexch.art reserves the right to remove events, markets and any other product from the website.</p>
		
		<p>Skyexch.art eserves the right to restrict the casino access of any player without prior notice.</p>
		
		<p>
			In all futures wagering (for example, total season wins, Super Bowl winner, etc.), the winner as
			determined by the Governing Body
			will also be declared the winner for betting purposes except when the minimum number of games required
			for the future to have
			“action” has not been completed.
		</p>

			Majeure which could reasonably
			be considered to be outside our control despite our execution of reasonable preventative measures such
			as: an act of God; trade or
			labour dispute; power cut; act, failure or omission of any government or authority; obstruction or
			failure of telecommunication
			services; or any other delay or failure caused by a third party, and we will not be liable for any
			resulting loss or damage that
			you may suffer. In such an event, we reserve the right to cancel or suspend the Service without
			incurring any liability.
		</p>
		
		<h3>13. Liability</h3>
